=head1 Comments

Comments in a programming language are use for a number of reasons.
Many times they are used to explain a hairy piece of code, or to document
hidden features of a function, or to provide a summary of how a function works
in a higher level.  They are ualso used to disable certain blocks of code.

Many programs today support two types of comments, commenting out a line
or the end of a line, or commenting out a block of code.  The idea behind
our language is that comments that add value to a piece of code, a function,
var, or code block will be a part of the syntax of the language.

This will hopefully eliminate the majority of comments in code.  We will
still support comments for blocking out code, and or adding comments to
other locations.  To keep this simple and hopefully avoid errors we are
choosing to only support single line comments with a #
So on a given line anything after a '#' and before a newline is considered
a comment.
