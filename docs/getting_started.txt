To get going with things:

cd newlang/src
perl ./doit.pl
	This will generate two different languages src/LPC and sweet/SWEET

At this point they are basically the same some slight syntax differences.
You can't do much other than pretty print a program.
	(Assuming it is accepted)
Some things to try:
	lpc/LPC -h
	lpc/LPC -p ../examp/fib.lpc
	lpc/LPC -c ../examp/ugly.lpc 

You'll probably want to look at the following code:
doit.pl:
	calls bnfc with our language inputs.
	Modifys the Makefiles bnfc builds to:
		fix pretty printing a bit
		add additional targets for our language
	compiles our code
	runs a simple test
main.c:
	This is the main commandline interface for our programs	

lpc/Makefile: to see whats going on most of this was generated by
	bnfc with some slight modifications by doit.pl
