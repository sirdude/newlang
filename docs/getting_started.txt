To get going with things:

cd newlang/src
perl ./doit.pl build
	This will generate two different languages bin/lpc and bin/sweet

At this point they are basically the same some slight syntax differences.
You can't do much other than pretty print a program.
	(Assuming it is accepted)
Some things to try:
	./bin/lpc -h
	./bin/lpc -p ./examp/fib.lpc
	./bin/lpc -c ./examp/ugly.lpc 

	perl ./doit.pl -h

You'll probably want to look at the following code:
doit.pl:
	calls bnfc with our language inputs.
	Modifys the Makefiles bnfc builds to:
		fix pretty printing a bit
		add additional targets for our language
	compiles our code
	runs a simple test
main.c:
	This is the main commandline interface for our programs	

lpc/Makefile: to see whats going on most of this was generated by
	bnfc with some slight modifications by doit.pl
