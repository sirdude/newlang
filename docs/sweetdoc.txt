Utility like perldoc
	Works on pakcages, functions, variables, types, keywords

Basically it searches for an item and then finds any documentation attached
	to that item and displays it.

Possible search order:
	Keywords
	Types
	Basic functions
	Packages	(looks for variables/functions)
	Code (looks for variables/functions)

On the last two list files it found it in and position along with documentation.
