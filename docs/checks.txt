Check for mix of whitespace (tabs/spaces)

Check for vars that do not have comments.
Check for functions that do not have comments.

Check for definition using a keyword.
Check for var masking, function masking.  Have a way to

Check for while where condition is modified in the statement.
Check for complex for loops as well.
Check for complex if statements also.
Check for vars defined after code in a block.

check for ignoring return values

check for inheritable cloning, or inheriting non inheritable?
Check inherit exists, also test enheritable : would need to create

Have a way to printout varname, scope where it is defined and current value.
Builtin test function for a function?  If so warn if no test function defined.
