New Language: SWEET

=head1 DESCRIPTION

What is this thing?

I've used quite a few programming languages over the years.  Some of them
I like better than others, and they each have advantages and disadvantages.
If I had to rate my top 5 Languages they currently would look something like
this:

=over 8

=item Perl, lpc, c, tcl, scheme

I read an interesting article on the web about adding visual feedback
to programming, which got me to thinking hey it would be really cool
to create a new language that builds on languages of the past.

I've formed some strong opinions on things I don't like about languages
and I want to try and see what I can do with them.  Here are some
of my motivations:

=over 8

=item 1. Simple consistent language.  Provide full functionality but keep
	things clean, and small.  Shoot for lua vs perl.
	don't have multiple syntaxes for or, if statements, comments

=item 2. Avoid cryptic code: sigils for variables, ? if syntax.
	Try to make sure code is readable and straight forward.

=item 3. Look at common things and reduce the work needed:
		foreach instead of all the mucking about with a for statement
		to loop through an array.
		Built-in string type instead of char *.

=item 4. You should be able to cut and paste the language and not mess it up.

=item 5. Compiler should have a built-in pretty printer.

=item 6. Compiler should have a built-in Perl critic type functionality.

=item 7. Strongly typed.

=item 8. Allow object oriented programming, not everything needs to be an
object though.

=item 9. If you look at comments I would guess that 80-90% of them are
when you declare a variable or a function.  If we have comments as
part of the syntax of the actual language we could do cool things
like hide them in the editor unless you are actually looking at
that code.

=item 10. Worry less about whitespace, at the same time code must be 
readable in a standard terminal.

=head2 What's here?

So far not a lot.  I'm starting with working on the syntax.  This involves
writing the documentation for the language and starting to come up with
a grammar.  Along with that I'd like to justify why the language is doing
what it is doing.  I'm starting with LPC as a base because I think its the
closest to what I envision the final language looking like at this point.

=head2 What are the plans?

=over 8

=item 1. I plan on writing the documentation describing the language.

=item 2. Creating a bnf of the language.

=item 3. using bnfc to create an interpreter/pretty printer/critic for the
language.
