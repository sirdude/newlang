=HEAD1 New Language (Name Unknown)

=HEAD2 VERSION 0.0

=HEAD2 What is this thing?
I've used quite a few programming languages over the years.  Some of them
I like better than others, and they each have advantages and disadvantages.
If I had to rate my top 5 Languages they currently would look something like
this:
	Perl, lpc, c, tcl, lisp

I read an interesting article on the web about adding visual feedback
to programming, which got me to thinking hey it would be really cool
to create a new language that builds on languages of the past.

I've formed some strong opinions on things I don't like about languages
and I want to try and see what I can do with them.  Here are some
of my motivations:

1. Simple consistant language.
	don't have mutiple syntaxes for or, if statements, comments
2. Avoid sigils for varables.
3. Compiler should have a built in pretty printer.
4. You should be able to cut and paste the language and not mess things up.
5. Compiler should have a builtin perlcritic type functionality.
6. Avoid common programming issues.
7. Strongly typed.
8. Should have builtin string type.
9. Allow object oriented programming, not everything needs to be an
	object though.
10. If you look at comments I would guess that 80-90% of them are
	when you declare a variable or a function.  If we built in
	comments into the syntax of the application we could do cool things
	like hide them in the editor unless you are actually looking at
	that code.
11. Worry less about whitespace, at the same time code must be readable in a 
	standard terminal.

=HEAD2 What's here?

So far not a lot.  I'm starting with working on the syntax.  This involves
writing the documentation for the language and starting to come up with
a grammar.  Along with that I'd like to justify why the language is doing
what it is doing.  I'm starting with LPC as a base because I think its the
closest to what I envision the final language looking like at this point.

=HEAD2 What are the plans?

1. I plan on writing the documentation describing the language.
2. Grecating a bnf of the language.
3. using bnfc to create an interpreter/pretty printer for the
	language.

=HEAD2 License

This code is currently under the CC license, you can do whatever you
want to with it.  This may change the future to something like
the GPL depending on how things go.
