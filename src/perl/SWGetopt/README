Kent Mein version 0.01
====================================

OVERVIEW

The SWGetopt module is maybe a bit too ambituous, the general idea 
behind this, is to provide a tool to create a command line interface
for an application, and at the same time make it self documenting.
It is based off of GNU C getopt/getopt_long ideas.

Goals:
	Simple clean interface builder for commandline option parsing.
	Documenting the interface is built in.
	This documentation includes: --help as well as manual docs.
