Basics:

Define policies

Policies look something like this:
	Name
	Criticality  (A rank 1-5 or 1-10)  Higher the # the more likely it's
		a real problem.
	Package groups so you can enable/disable stuff.
	Node types this policy affects.
	violates function takes two arguments( current node, pointer to full
		document);
		The violates function checks to make sure were evaluating the
		correct node type if not return.
		Look at node and or surrounding nodes for issue.  If
		there is an issue return problem otherwise return nothing.
	Documentation for the policy (What is it and why?)


Then what you do is this:
	Load all polices you want based on criticality and packages.
	Check all of the policies that apply to the entire document.
	create node tree out of the code.
	for each node in the tree,
		Determine what policies apply to that node, 
		if there is a violation, print the location and the violation.
