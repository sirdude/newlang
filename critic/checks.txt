Check for variable masking, function masking.  Have a way to 
	flag it as ok via code. (type modifier redefineable?)

Check for variables defined after code in a block.

check for inheritable cloning, or inheriting non inheritable?
Check inherit exists, also test inheritable : would need to create
	a visited list, expand this so you can check a directory and only
	check files once.

check to make sure objects are not orphaned? (destroy them when your done)
check that open things like files are closed when done.

Warn if variables share the name of a variable at a higher scope.

Warn if while statements check have no way of modifying their contents.
Warn if switch/if statements have unreachable code.

Have a way to printout variable name, scope where it is defined and 
	current value.
Have a way to given an object, print the variables defined in it with current
	values, as well as functions defined in that object.

Built-in test function for a function?  If so warn if no test function defined.
	Also check for blah.test that doesn't have a function defined.
	tests should cover all return statements & return values.
	tests should also cover important edge cases.

check for assignment in conditional:
	if (X = 5) {
