Our compiler needs the following libraries:

Getopt
statemachine
AST handler (reader/writer)

There are probably others as well, for now this is the focus.  I'm planning
on writing these in 3 languages perl/c/sweet so I can compare things and
improve sweet.  Make it easier to use and functional and can contrast it with
other languages I know.  Potentially I can then write a bootstrap compiler
in all 3 languages as well.
