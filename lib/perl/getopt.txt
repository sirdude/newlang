The getopt library is maybe a bit too ambituous, the general idea behind
this library is to provide a tool to create a command line interface
for an application, and at the same time make it self documenting.
It's based off of GNU C's getopt/getopt_long ideas.

Goals:
	Simple clean interface builder for commandline option parsing.
	Documenting the interface is built in.
	This documentation includes: --help as well as manual docs.
